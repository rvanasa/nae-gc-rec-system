Hypothesis (prediction): Radish plants given water with a pH of 7 will grow taller than radish plants given water with a pH lower than 7 because plants will not grow well with water that is acidic. Materials: radish seeds small plant pots filled with soil water samples each with a different acidity: pH 4, pH 5, pH 6, and pH 7 graduated cylinders labels ruler {img:images/States2017/WA/WA_8thGr_2007_1.png} Procedure: 1. Label six pots pH 4, six pots pH 5, six pots pH 6, and six pots pH 7 as shown in the Investigation Setup diagram. 2. Plant one radish seed in each pot. 3. Every three days pour 5 milliliters of water with the labeled pH into each pot. 4. Measure and record the height of the tallest leaf of each radish plant after watering. 5. After two weeks, calculate and record the average plant height for each of the four pH groups.

TAKS_2009_8_15,15,1,D,1,1,TAKS,8,2009,"Ancient Trees The climate in central California's White Mountains is cold and dry. Clouds traveling east tend to lose their moisture over the Sierra Nevada, a large mountain range just west of the White Mountains. For this reason, the White Mountains receive less than 30 cm of precipitation per year. Most of this precipitation falls as snow. The White Mountains are the home of the oldest living trees on Earth, bristlecone pines that can survive thousands of years. Bristlecone pines have several strategies for surviving in this dry environment. These trees often grow in patches of dolomite soil. Dolomite is a type of limestone that holds more moisture than the surrounding sandstone. The light color of the dolomite soil reflects sunlight, helping keep the trees' roots cool and conserving the limited moisture. Needles on these trees can live 20 to 30 years. They provide a stable source of photosynthesis for many years. These ancient trees teach scientists about Earth's climate history. Each spring and summer the trees grow a layer of new cells between the living wood and the bark. The trees grow more in a wet year than in a dry year. Because these trees live a long time, they can be used as a record of climate change over thousands of years. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/TAKS/TAKS_8_2009_9.png} The dolomite soil keeps the roots of the bristlecone pines cool by - (A) absorbing chemical energy from the roots (B) transforming heat energy into chemical energy (C) transferring thermal energy from the soil to the roots (D) reflecting the heat energy from the soil around the roots",,Dev

Question: What is the effect of different lid colors on the air temperature inside a glass jar exposed to a lamp? Hypothesis: The darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy. Materials: glass jar lamp four colored lids: black, dark gray, light gray, and white thermometer meterstick stopwatch {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/WA-MSP/WA-MSP_8_2012_1.png} Procedure: 1. Put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar. 2. Make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24° C. 3. Place lamp 5 centimeters away from the lid and turn on the lamp. 4. After 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as Trial 1. 5. Turn off lamp and wait until the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature. 6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for Trials 2 and 3. 7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the dark gray, light gray, and white lids. 8. Calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color.
