{"id":"TAKS_2009_8_15","question":{"stem":"Ancient Trees The climate in central California's White Mountains is cold and dry. Clouds traveling east tend to lose their moisture over the Sierra Nevada, a large mountain range just west of the White Mountains. For this reason, the White Mountains receive less than 30 cm of precipitation per year. Most of this precipitation falls as snow. The White Mountains are the home of the oldest living trees on Earth, bristlecone pines that can survive thousands of years. Bristlecone pines have several strategies for surviving in this dry environment. These trees often grow in patches of dolomite soil. Dolomite is a type of limestone that holds more moisture than the surrounding sandstone. The light color of the dolomite soil reflects sunlight, helping keep the trees' roots cool and conserving the limited moisture. Needles on these trees can live 20 to 30 years. They provide a stable source of photosynthesis for many years. These ancient trees teach scientists about Earth's climate history. Each spring and summer the trees grow a layer of new cells between the living wood and the bark. The trees grow more in a wet year than in a dry year. Because these trees live a long time, they can be used as a record of climate change over thousands of years. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/TAKS/TAKS_8_2009_9.png} The dolomite soil keeps the roots of the bristlecone pines cool by -","choices":[{"text":"absorbing chemical energy from the roots","label":"A"},{"text":"transforming heat energy into chemical energy","label":"B"},{"text":"transferring thermal energy from the soil to the roots","label":"C"},{"text":"reflecting the heat energy from the soil around the roots","label":"D"}]},"answerKey":"D"}
