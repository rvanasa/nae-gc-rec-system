MSA_2012_8_39,39,1,C,1,1,MSA,8,2012,"Learning to Live With the Laws of Motion Freed from the grip of Earth's gravity, astronauts find themselves in a living physics textbook. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, during his pioneering first orbit of the Earth in 1961, was the first to experience the practical effects. He put down his pencil while writing out his log. Obeying Newton's first law-the same principle of uniform motion that keeps the planets moving around the sun-the pencil floated out of reach: Gagarin had to complete his log by speaking into a tape recorder. Nowadays astronauts keep equipment in place with Velcro® or bungee straps. Newton's Second Law states that force is needed to accelerate or decelerate a body. In practice this means astronauts must learn how to push themselves carefully through their spacecraft, or else they will simply float around helplessly. And once astronauts get moving they have to remember to stop themselves as they near where they want to be. Otherwise they'll keep going until they hit something-or someone. First-timers tend to collect a lot of bruises. Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This, too, has very apparent consequences for astronauts: if they so much as try to turn a screw without anchoring themselves to a wall, they'll find themselves twisting instead. The reaction from even the mildest of actions- typing at a computer keyboard, say-will send an astronaut floating away. It's not that the laws of motion are any different on Earth than in space. But Earth's gravitational field has such an overwhelming force it masks their precise effects. And gravity is integral to all sorts of phenomena that we take for granted. For example, the air in our homes circulates naturally: hot air rises because it is lighter than cool air, and convection currents form. In orbit, nothing is lighter than anything else, so ordinary convection currents can't exist. Without a ventilation fan, sleeping astronauts would suffocate in the carbon dioxide that accumulated around their faces. Similarly, weightless flames behave very differently from their Earth-bound counterparts. Instead of a flickering column of hot gas, a flame in orbit is a small blue sphere. An astronaut applies a force to a keyboard that is attached to the wall of a space shuttle. {img:images/States2017/MD/MD_8thGr_2012_14.png} After the astronaut applies the force to the keyboard, the astronaut moves (A) faster and upward (B) at a uniform speed and downward (C) at a uniform speed and away from the keyboard (D) faster and toward the keyboard at a constant rate",science,Test

MSA_2013_8_16,16,1,D,1,1,MSA,8,2013,"A Natural Snake-Bite Antidote? Snake bites and bee stings can be either painful or downright deadly, depending on which species is doing the biting, and sometimes whether the person being bitten is allergic to the venom. New research in mice suggests that these bites and stings would be even more dangerous if not for a special defensive trick that the mouse's immune system can pull off. Dr. Stephen Galli of Stanford University and his colleagues studied mast cells, which are immune cells that contribute to the inflammation that's part of asthma, allergies and even the extreme, anaphylactic shock that can happen to some people with severe allergies to things like peanuts. In these cases, the immune system gets mixed up and thinks it's being attacked by something harmful. But, mast cells also do beneficial things in the body. The scientists discovered that the cells also play a helpful role against certain snake and honeybee venoms. In their study they showed that the cells protected mice, making the venom's effects less harmful. The cells released an enzyme that broke down dangerous components of the venom of a snake called the Israeli mole viper. Dr. Galli said that it might someday be possible to make better snake bite or bee sting treatments that are based on this type of enzyme. More research will be necessary to see if this is possible. Dr. Galli thinks that this feature of the mast-cell defense system may have evolved, in animals that are prey to snakes or get stung by bees, partly as a way to help to protect against venom. This defense isn't foolproof or perfect, but it gives the prey animals a better chance of survival, especially if they get less than a ""full dose"" of venom in the bite of a poisonous snake. The Israeli mole viper has a small head, shiny black scales, small eyes, and hollow fangs. {img:images/States2017/MD/MD_8thGr_2013_8.png} Which feature enables the snake to inject venom into prey animals?

MSA_2015_8_21,21,1,B,1,1,MSA,8,2015,"Power of Urine Runs a Battery Scientists have developed a way to turn urine into electricity. Cheap, disposable, and renewable, urine-powered batteries may be the perfect power source for disposable health care test kits called biochips, the researchers say. ""We are striving to develop cheap, disposable credit card-sized biochips for disease detection,"" said battery developer Ki Bang Lee. ""Our battery can be easily integrated into such devices, supplying electricity upon contact with biofluids such as urine."" Scientists around the world are clamoring to design inexpensive biochips to quickly test for a variety of diseases. But no one has been able to make a similarly small and inexpensive power source. Lee and his team of researchers at Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology have tackled this problem by using the very substance being tested-urine-to power the test. To make the battery, Lee and his team soaked a piece of paper in copper chloride and then sandwiched it between strips of magnesium and copper. Then they laminated the credit card-sized unit between transparent plastic films. When a drop of urine is added to the copper chloride paper, a chemical reaction takes place and produces electricity, which is harnessed by the battery. A few drops will generate about 1.5 volts, the same as a AA battery. The battery needs to be developed further to make it commercially viable. ""Our urine-activated battery would be integrated into biochip systems for health care diagnostic applications,"" Lee said. Lee and his team also found that they could alter the battery's performance- voltage, power, or duration-by adjusting the design or materials. The chemical composition of urine indicates a person's general health and is widely used in diagnostic tests. For instance, doctors measure the concentration of the sugar glucose to determine whether someone is diabetic. Lee predicts that one day people will be able to monitor their own health at home using biochips powered by this type of battery.

Hypothesis (prediction): As the volume of water in mud increases, a mudflow will travel farther because water erodes soil. Materials: dry soil water balance stirring rod graduated cylinder beaker piece of rain gutter brick meter stick {img:images/States2017/WA/WA_8thGr_2009_3.png} Procedure: 1. Put the rain gutter and brick together as shown in the Investigation Setup diagram. 2. Stir 100 grams of dry soil and 20 milliliters (mL) of water together in a beaker to make mud. 3. Pour the mud into the top of the raised end of the rain gutter as shown in the Investigation Setup diagram. 4. Measure and record the distance the front of the mudflow traveled as Trial 1. 5. Rinse and dry the rain gutter to remove the mud. 6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 two times as Trials 2 and 3. 7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 for 25 mL of water, 30 mL of water, and 35 mL of water. 8. Calculate and record the average distance the mudflow traveled for each volume of water used.

MEAP_2004_8_10,10,1,D,1,1,MEAP,8,2004,"Northwest of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, in Lake Superior, is Isle Royale National Park. The island is 45 miles long and 5 to 8 miles wide. In the early 1900s, moose arrived on the island (apparently swimming over from Canada). With no predators on the island, and plenty of water plants, twigs, and leaves for the moose to feed on, the moose population increased greatly. By the 1930s, the food was depleted, and hundreds of moose starved. Following a fire, the food supply-and the moose-recovered. About 10 years later the food dwindled again, and the moose starved once more. During 1948-1949, as a result of an extremely cold winter, Lake Superior froze over. A pack of eastern timber wolves migrated across the ice from Canada and established themselves on the island. The wolf population now numbers between 25 and 40. The wolves kill the very young, very old, sick or weak moose. The moose population, at a ratio of about 30 moose per wolf, is now stable and healthy. The balance is aided by a population of beaver, which builds dams for ponds and beaver meadows, supplying the moose with additional plant growth. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/MEAP/MEAP_8_2004_2.png} Why did the moose on Isle Royale starve?

MEAP_2004_8_11,11,1,D,1,1,MEAP,8,2004,"Northwest of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, in Lake Superior, is Isle Royale National Park. The island is 45 miles long and 5 to 8 miles wide. In the early 1900s, moose arrived on the island (apparently swimming over from Canada). With no predators on the island, and plenty of water plants, twigs, and leaves for the moose to feed on, the moose population increased greatly. By the 1930s, the food was depleted, and hundreds of moose starved. Following a fire, the food supply-and the moose-recovered. About 10 years later the food dwindled again, and the moose starved once more. During 1948-1949, as a result of an extremely cold winter, Lake Superior froze over. A pack of eastern timber wolves migrated across the ice from Canada and established themselves on the island. The wolf population now numbers between 25 and 40. The wolves kill the very young, very old, sick or weak moose. The moose population, at a ratio of about 30 moose per wolf, is now stable and healthy. The balance is aided by a population of beaver, which builds dams for ponds and beaver meadows, supplying the moose with additional plant growth. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/MEAP/MEAP_8_2004_2.png} How do the moose benefit from the beaver population?
