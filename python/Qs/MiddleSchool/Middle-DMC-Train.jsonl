{"id":"LEAP__8_1","question":{"stem":"Climate Feedback Loops Climate feedback loops are an important area of research for scientists. What is a climate feedback loop? A climate feedback loop happens when a change in our climate causes an environmental impact that produces further climate change. Climate feedback loops can be both negative and positive: Negative feedback loop: A negative feedback loop occurs when an environmental impact offsets the climate change such that they balance out. Under global warming, the impact would create a cooling effect, offsetting the warming trend. Positive feedback loop: A positive feedback loop occurs when an environmental impact increases the climate change such that the first change is amplified. Under global warming, the impact would add to climate warming by creating further heating. {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_8thGr_11.png} Why are feedback loops so important to climate change? Feedback loops have the ability to greatly affect climate change. The big question is what overall effect the world's positive and negative feedback loops will have on climate change. The more we understand about them, the more confidence we have in our climate projections for the future. The better our projections, the better we can understand climate change and prepare for it. Which climate feedback loops are well understood? Some types of feedback loops are fairly well understood, such as those involving water vapor and albedo. Scientists use these feedback loops to improve their predictions about climate change through the use of computer models. This means that scientists have taken into consideration the effect these feedback loops will have as the climate warms in the future. Water Vapor (Positive Feedback) As air gets warmer, its ability to hold moisture increases. Our atmosphere is getting warmer because of climate change and, as a result, it is holding more water vapor. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas-when in the atmosphere, it helps the Earth hold on to more energy from the Sun. So a warming climate means more water vapor, which in turn warms the climate further. Albedo (Positive Feedback) Albedo is the percentage of light reflected by a surface, which is a very important consideration in climate science. A surface with a high albedo, such as snow or sand, will reflect more sunlight back out to space. The lower the albedo, the more energy and heat is absorbed. Global warming is causing ice and snow to melt, revealing the land or ocean underneath. Ice and snow reflect a lot of sunlight-certainly more than land and the oceans. So as the ice melts, more of the Sun's energy is absorbed and so the planet gets warmer still-which in turn melts even more snow and ice. Which climate feedback loops are less well understood? Other feedbacks, such as the global carbon cycle, are not as easy to understand. They are being included in models, but more research is needed to fully understand these processes. The models are updated as new information becomes available. Global Carbon Cycle (Currently Negative Feedback) For every ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere, within a year, about half of that will be absorbed by the ocean and land-for example, through trees and plants. This process helps reduce the effect of CO2 emissions on global warming. However, if large quantities of carbon dioxide continue to be emitted, it could decrease the benefit of this cycle, which would have a huge impact on the future of the climate. Global warming could affect the carbon cycle in two areas, the ocean and the land: 1. Ocean changes can result in positive climate change feedback loops, for two reasons: As the ocean absorbs CO2, it becomes more acidic. Acidic water cannot absorb as much additional CO2. As the temperature of the ocean increases, its capacity to absorb CO2 is also reduced. {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_8thGr_12.png} The illustration above is a simplified carbon cycle, showing current CO2 absorption rates of the land and oceans. 2. Land changes can result in positive or negative climate change feedback loops. Examples include: Negative feedback: As temperatures increase, the areas in which trees can grow will extend north to higher latitudes. New trees will absorb CO2, taking it out of the atmosphere. Positive feedback: As temperatures increase, soils, plants, and trees in tropical zones will become more heat stressed. This could cause the release of the huge amounts of carbon they store, threatening the future of important ecologies such as the Amazon Rain Forest. A lot of research continues to go on in this area. Advances in understanding will enable us to improve our confidence in projections resulting from climate models.

The more we understand about them, the more confidence we have in our climate projections for the future. The better our projections, the better we can understand climate change and prepare for it. Which climate feedback loops are well understood? Some types of feedback loops are fairly well understood, such as those involving water vapor and albedo. Scientists use these feedback loops to improve their predictions about climate change through the use of computer models. This means that scientists have taken into consideration the effect these feedback loops will have as the climate warms in the future. Water Vapor (Positive Feedback) As air gets warmer, its ability to hold moisture increases. Our atmosphere is getting warmer because of climate change and, as a result, it is holding more water vapor. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas-when in the atmosphere, it helps the Earth hold on to more energy from the Sun. So a warming climate means more water vapor, which in turn warms the climate further. Albedo (Positive Feedback) Albedo is the percentage of light reflected by a surface, which is a very important consideration in climate science. A surface with a high albedo, such as snow or sand, will reflect more sunlight back out to space. The lower the albedo, the more energy and heat is absorbed. Global warming is causing ice and snow to melt, revealing the land or ocean underneath. Ice and snow reflect a lot of sunlight-certainly more than land and the oceans. So as the ice melts, more of the Sun's energy is absorbed and so the planet gets warmer still-which in turn melts even more snow and ice. Which climate feedback loops are less well understood? Other feedbacks, such as the global carbon cycle, are not as easy to understand. They are being included in models, but more research is needed to fully understand these processes. The models are updated as new information becomes available. Global Carbon Cycle (Currently Negative Feedback) For every ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere, within a year, about half of that will be absorbed by the ocean and land-for example, through trees and plants. This process helps reduce the effect of CO2 emissions on global warming. However, if large quantities of carbon dioxide continue to be emitted, it could decrease the benefit of this cycle, which would have a huge impact on the future of the climate. Global warming could affect the carbon cycle in two areas, the ocean and the land: 1. Ocean changes can result in positive climate change feedback loops, for two reasons: As the ocean absorbs CO2, it becomes more acidic. Acidic water cannot absorb as much additional CO2. As the temperature of the ocean increases, its capacity to absorb CO2 is also reduced. {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_8thGr_12.png} The illustration above is a simplified carbon cycle, showing current CO2 absorption rates of the land and oceans. 2. Land changes can result in positive or negative climate change feedback loops. Examples include: Negative feedback: As temperatures increase, the areas in which trees can grow will extend north to higher latitudes. New trees will absorb CO2, taking it out of the atmosphere. Positive feedback: As temperatures increase, soils, plants, and trees in tropical zones will become more heat stressed. This could cause the release of the huge amounts of carbon they store, threatening the future of important ecologies such as the Amazon Rain Forest. A lot of research continues to go on in this area. Advances in understanding will enable us to improve our confidence in projections resulting from climate models. One effect of global warming is the retreat of mountain glaciers across the world. This results in less groundwater and water in streams in the summer.

{"id":"MSA_2013_8_27","question":{"stem":"Waste Not: Energy from Garbage and Sewage A hundred years ago, gas was collected from rotting sewage and used to light street lamps. New technologies hope to update this concept-tapping garbage as well as human waste-for an energy-hungry world. One promising device is called a microbial fuel cell. It makes electricity much like a hydrogen fuel cell, but it runs off wastewater. Sewage-eating bacteria drive a chemical process that generates current and, as a bonus, helps purify the water. Bruce Logan of Pennsylvania State University and his colleagues have constructed small microbial fuel cells, no bigger than a can that can power various devices, including a small fan. \"If you had 100,000 people and you treat their sewage, you could get up to 2.3 megawatts of continuous power, which is enough to supply electricity for 1,500 homes,\" Logan said. A megawatt is one million watts. A self-sufficient water-treatment device is also something that NASA is interested in. Bruce Rittman of Northwestern University is currently devising a microbial fuel cell that could be used on manned space missions. \"You have to recycle everything up in space,\" Rittman said. \"You want to capture food waste and human waste, as well as recycle water.\" A microbial fuel cell has some advantages over the more traditional method, called an anaerobic digester, which collects the methane, or \"biogas,\" that bacteria belch out when they consume organic material in the absence of oxygen. The methane is later burned to turn a turbine generator. \"Instead of going through the intermediate step of combustion, a cell makes the electricity directly,\" Rittman said. This direct route means that a microbial fuel cell could potentially extract more energy from a given amount of sewage. It also would avoid the pollution that burning methane produces. But both Rittman and Logan are quick to add that cells are still early in development, whereas digesters are in use, mostly in agriculture settings where the concentration of organic material is higher than from urban sewers.

{"id":"MSA_2015_8_20","question":{"stem":"Power of Urine Runs a Battery Scientists have developed a way to turn urine into electricity. Cheap, disposable, and renewable, urine-powered batteries may be the perfect power source for disposable health care test kits called biochips, the researchers say. \"We are striving to develop cheap, disposable credit card-sized biochips for disease detection,\" said battery developer Ki Bang Lee. \"Our battery can be easily integrated into such devices, supplying electricity upon contact with biofluids such as urine.\" Scientists around the world are clamoring to design inexpensive biochips to quickly test for a variety of diseases. But no one has been able to make a similarly small and inexpensive power source. Lee and his team of researchers at Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology have tackled this problem by using the very substance being tested-urine-to power the test. To make the battery, Lee and his team soaked a piece of paper in copper chloride and then sandwiched it between strips of magnesium and copper. Then they laminated the credit card-sized unit between transparent plastic films. When a drop of urine is added to the copper chloride paper, a chemical reaction takes place and produces electricity, which is harnessed by the battery. A few drops will generate about 1.5 volts, the same as a AA battery. The battery needs to be developed further to make it commercially viable. \"Our urine-activated battery would be integrated into biochip systems for health care diagnostic applications,\" Lee said. Lee and his team also found that they could alter the battery's performance- voltage, power, or duration-by adjusting the design or materials. The chemical composition of urine indicates a person's general health and is widely used in diagnostic tests. For instance, doctors measure the concentration of the sugar glucose to determine whether someone is diabetic. Lee predicts that one day people will be able to monitor their own health at home using biochips powered by this type of battery.

Sunlight strikes Earth at different angles due to the shape of Earth, as shown below. {img:images/States2017/WA/WA_8thGr_2006_1.png} Two students, Amy and Chris, wanted to know if the shape of Earth affects surface temperatures on Earth. They investigated this phenomenon with a model of the Earth-Sun system as described in the Earth-Sun Model. Question: What is the effect of the angle at which light strikes a wooden block on the surface temperature of that block? Hypothesis (prediction): As the angle that the light strikes the block increases to 90°, the block's surface temperature will increase because the light will strike the block more directly. Materials: wooden block thermometer black paper lamp protractor meter stick stand and clamp timer {img:images/States2017/WA/WA_8thGr_2006_2.png} Procedure: 1. Lay the thermometer on the wooden block. 2. Cover the lower end of the thermometer with black paper and attach the paper to the wooden block. 3. Tilt the block so the light beams will strike at a 15° angle as shown in the Investigation Setup diagram. 4. Record the starting temperature of the block's surface. 5. Turn on the lamp. Record the temperature after 2.5 minutes and again after 5 minutes. 6. Turn off the lamp and wait 10 minutes for the thermometer to return to room temperature. 7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 using 30°, 60°, and 90° angles. Keep the lamp at the same distance from the wooden block for each condition. 8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 two more times as trials 2 and 3.

Clouds traveling east tend to lose their moisture over the Sierra Nevada, a large mountain range just west of the White Mountains. For this reason, the White Mountains receive less than 30 cm of precipitation per year. Most of this precipitation falls as snow. The White Mountains are the home of the oldest living trees on Earth, bristlecone pines that can survive thousands of years. Bristlecone pines have several strategies for surviving in this dry environment. These trees often grow in patches of dolomite soil. Dolomite is a type of limestone that holds more moisture than the surrounding sandstone. The light color of the dolomite soil reflects sunlight, helping keep the trees' roots cool and conserving the limited moisture. Needles on these trees can live 20 to 30 years. They provide a stable source of photosynthesis for many years. These ancient trees teach scientists about Earth's climate history. Each spring and summer the trees grow a layer of new cells between the living wood and the bark. The trees grow more in a wet year than in a dry year. Because these trees live a long time, they can be used as a record of climate change over thousands of years. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/8thGr/TAKS/TAKS_8_2009_9.png} A bristlecone pine in the White Mountains usually adds a new ring when which of the following occurs?","choices":[{"text":"Earth's daily rotation is complete.","label":"A"},{"text":"The full moon causes a monthly high tide.","label":"B"},{"text":"The new moon is visible from Earth's surface.","label":"C"},{"text":"Earth's Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun.","label":"D"}]},"answerKey":"D"}
